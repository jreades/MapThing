/**
 * You will need to define the 'bounding box' or envelope
 * for the sketch. This is used to tell Processing where
 * the top-left and bottom-right corners are *geographically*
 * for the initial view. You can easily implement zoom and pan, 
 * but this will set out the view that users see when you start
 * up. 
 *
 * Right now the projection param is not enormously useful 
 * since you *must* have all of your Shapefiles in the
 * same coordinate system because the library isn't (yet)
 * smart enough to figure out and reproject the data
 * on-the-fly based on the coordinate system. For the sake of
 * future-proofing your application, however, you *should* use 
 * the correct projection for your data.
 *
 * If you want to specify a projection other than lat/long or 
 * the British National Gride, then you will need to do a little
 * work to figure out the number corresponding to the standard 
 * EPSG/OGC WKT form. To do this, go to http://spatialreference.org/
 * and then pick 'OGC WKT' as the format; and then look for the *last*
 * 'AUTHORITY' declaration in the PROJCS command. That number is what 
 * you would pass in to the BoundingBox constructor.
 * 
 * The default (if you don't specify a reference) is
 * WGS84, but because I do a lot of work in the UK I've 
 * made it easy to use OSGB coordinates too. For everything
 * else you're on your own right now.
 * 
 * The order for the parameters is:
 * Projection, North coordinate (float), East coordinate 
 * (float), South coordinate (float), and West coordinate 
 * (float).
